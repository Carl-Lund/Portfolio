        <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a passionate Software Engineer with expertise in several programming languages. 
            From Front End building with HTML, CSS, React.js, and Swift, to Back End structuring with Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, and C++, 
            to miscellaneous work with SQL, Arduino, and 6502. There is likely not a data structure or algorithm I haven't encountered before. 
            As a lifelong student, that is a statement I will continue to try to uphold. 
            At the end of the day, however, my goal personally and professionally is to build user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing digital experiences.
